Code is written for a Teensy microcontroller and utilized the serial MIDI

ITP Midi note player:  This code will play a midi note for the duration that a pushbutton is pressed, 
and the midi note can be adjusted using a potentiometer.  
The midi note can not be actively adjusted while the button is depressed.  
The note has to be adjusted then the button re-pressed to hear the change.  
I would prefer to be able to actively change the note while the button is depressed.


MidiArrayTest:
An array of midi notes called melody[ ]; will play when the button is depressed.  
ex: int melody[] = {60, 61, 65, 67, 68, 72, 73, 77, 79, 80, 84};  is a japanese C scale
I would like to be able to cycle through the array of midi notes with the potentiometer while the button is depressed.
I believe this will have to be done using a switch statement like: 
switch (potentiometerValue) {
  case 10-20:  playNote1();     break;
  case 21-30:  playNote2();     break;
  case 31-40:  playNote3();   break;
}

I am eventually wanting to incorporate an accelerometer and IR proximity sensor to control various midi scales, but for now 
I am just experimenting with a potentiometer to control the notes being played.
